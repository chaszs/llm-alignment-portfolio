# Scope of the Idioms Module

This document defines the scope of the **Idioms** module, specifying which linguistic phenomena are evaluated, under which conditions, and within what methodological boundaries.

Its purpose is to avoid ambiguity, prevent unnecessary overlap with other modules, and set clear expectations regarding the type of evaluation performed.

---

## In-Scope Phenomena

The Idioms module evaluates LLM behavior when handling **non-literal language**, with particular emphasis on idiomatic expressions and related semantic–pragmatic phenomena.

The scope includes, but is not limited to:

- Idiomatic expressions and fixed phrases
- Fossilized or conventional metaphors
- Non-compositional meaning
- Language with strong cultural or contextual dependency
- Implicit or pragmatically inferred intent
- Paraphrasing of idiomatic language while preserving meaning
- Translation with non-literal semantic equivalence
- Detection of errors caused by inappropriate literal interpretation

The evaluation focuses on **meaning preservation**, **pragmatic adequacy**, and **linguistic naturalness**, rather than on creative language generation.

---

## Types of Tasks Evaluated

Within this scope, the module covers evaluation tasks such as:

- Identification of idiomatic expressions in context
- Explanation of implicit or non-literal meaning
- Paraphrasing while preserving idiomatic intent
- Translation avoiding misleading literal renderings
- Evaluation of semantic equivalence across formulations
- Detection of semantic drift in reformulations

---

## Languages and Working Context

Tasks and examples evaluated within this module have been developed across three languages:

- Spanish
- Catalan
- English

The analysis was conducted in contexts related to linguistic evaluation and alignment initiatives developed within the framework of the **ALIA** and **AINA** projects, with particular attention to idiomaticity, semantic equivalence, and cultural adequacy across languages.

This contextual reference does not imply exclusive institutional affiliation and is provided solely to describe the linguistic environment in which the work was carried out.

## Out-of-Scope Elements

To maintain a clear and controlled evaluation framework, the Idioms module explicitly excludes:

- Exhaustive lists or glossaries of idiomatic expressions
- Didactic language teaching or learner-oriented explanations
- Creative generation of novel metaphors or expressions
- Isolated evaluation of basic grammatical correctness
- Literary or stylistic analysis
- Phonetic or pronunciation-related phenomena
- Cultural or sociological value judgments not grounded in linguistic evaluation

These aspects may be relevant in other contexts but fall outside the objectives of this module.

---

## Relation to Other Modules

- **Judge**: Idioms does not evaluate general reasoning, instruction compliance, or safety, except where these aspects directly affect non-literal semantic interpretation.
- **Speech**: Idioms does not address auditory perception, prosody, or transcription-related phenomena.

Each module maintains a distinct focus to ensure precise and non-redundant evaluation.

## Methodological Note

The scope defined here prioritizes semantic depth over superficial coverage.  
The evaluation of idiomatic language requires specialized and tightly controlled criteria, which is why this module is intentionally scoped and bounded.

All examples used are synthetic and intended solely for methodological demonstration purposes.
