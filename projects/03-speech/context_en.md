# Working Context and Reference Sources

The evaluation described in this module is informed by real-world speech processing scenarios, similar to those addressed by open initiatives for speech data collection and validation.

Among these initiatives, **Mozilla Common Voice** is referenced as a representative example of multilingual, diverse, and non-controlled speech corpora, useful for observing error patterns, phonetic variation, and quality degradation in ASR systems.

The mention of Common Voice is strictly contextual and does not imply direct affiliation, dataset authorship, or involvement in its design.
